## What this post covers
This post introduces Microsoft Fabric at a high level and explains why it exists.

## What is Microsoft Fabric?
Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that unifies data engineering, data warehousing, real-time analytics, and business intelligence into a single SaaS experience.

It is built to reduce fragmentation across analytics tools while improving integration with Power BI.

## Core Components
- Lakehouse
- Data Warehouse
- Data Engineering
- Data Science
- Real-Time Analytics
- Power BI

## How Fabric differs from Azure Synapse
Fabric simplifies what Synapse offers by:
- Removing infrastructure management
- Providing unified storage (OneLake)
- Tight Power BI integration by default

## Key Takeaways
- Fabric is SaaS-first
- OneLake is the storage backbone
- Power BI is a core component, not an add-on
